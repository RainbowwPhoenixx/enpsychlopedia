2,15,8:26,"<pre>Henry: Shawn, could you... help me in the kitchen with these? Thank you. We'll be right back.
Gus: So, heard about Pluto? That's messed up.
Susan: Yeah.</pre>"
5,11,39:46,"<pre>Gus: He's really not that smooth.
Shawn: Oh I'm not that smooth? (imitating Gus) 'Hey, you hear about Pluto? That's messed up right?' How many times has that landed?
Gus: That's a player's move, Shawn.
Shawn: It's not a player's move. That's like an astronomer's move.</pre>"
6,5,33:17,"<pre>Shawn, pretending to be Gus: What's happenin' baby?
Security guard: Afternoon Mr. Guster.
Shawn: Uh, did you hear about Pluto?</pre>"
7,15,41:14:"Shawn, to Gus: Did you hear about Pluto? That's messed up right?</pre>"
8,1,4:24,"<pre>Gus: Have you heard about Pluto? That's m-
Shawn, pulling Gus away: No.</pre>"
8,10,42:03,"<pre>Gus: My name is Burton Guster. I'm a realist, a dreamer, an adventurer, a lover of Harry Potter, vintage safes, all things Jamaican. And I wanna spend the rest of my life making you the center of my universe. A universe that contains a solar system with nine planets.</pre>"
8,10,45:17,"<pre>Shawn: Juliet O'Hara, I do not believe in love at first sight because I didn't even need to see you to know that I wanted to spend forever with you.
Shawn, to Gus: That didn't make a ton of sense, did it?
Gus: The center of your universe, nine planets.
Shawn: Gus, has that Pluto line ever worked on anybody?
Gus: No.</pre>"
9,1,35:08,"<pre>Shawn: It would appear that she's coming this way.
Gus: Well, that's not right. Do you know her?
Shawn: Why would I know a woman in a 'Nine Planet Solar System' T-shirt?
Gus: Well, I don't know her, Shawn, and she's ruining my approach. I am the hunter. Me.</pre>"
9,1,36:30,"<pre>Selene: That's where it would be, planet number nine. Obviously, if this telescope were powerful enough.
Gus: I hate to correct you, but Pluto's way over there.
Selene: Why would I be pointing it at Pluto?
Gus: 'Cause you're showing me the ninth planet.
Selene: Yes. I'm showing you Eris.
Gus: Eris? The dwarf planet? Eris is stupid. Pluto is, has been, and will always be the ninth planet.
Selene: Why would we make Pluto a planet again? We've already rectified that mistake.
Gus: 'Mistake'? Hasn't Pluto been through enough already?
Selene: Eris is bigger.
Gus: By 15 miles. By your logic, why don't we make everything a planet? Why don't we make that Nativity Jesus a planet?
Selene: Why don't we make your forehead a planet?</pre>"
